Submitted by: **Artem Guz**

This web app: **insert description**

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] **Enhanced Filtering: Cats with incomplete or 'Unknown' attribute values are automatically filtered out to ensure users only see cats with complete and meaningful information.**
- [x] **Responsive Attribute Display: Attribute labels (like Origin and Lifespan) are clickable and styled to indicate interactivity, improving user engagement and understanding of the app's functionality.**
